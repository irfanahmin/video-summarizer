What is machine learning? Machine learning is a field that utilizes statistical and else's techniques to enable computers to learn from data without explicit programming. It focuses on achieving good empirical predictive performance and is applied to problems that lack explicit algorithmic solutions. Machine learning uses data and algorithms to mimic human learning gradually improving accuracy by finding relationships and patterns in data through training. The process involves using statistical methods to train algorithms for making classifications, predictions, and uncovering key insights into data mining projects. The ultimate goal is to give computers the ability to learn from data and make predictions based on input. Some examples of machine learning include image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles.
